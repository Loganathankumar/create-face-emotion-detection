# Senior Data Engineer based in India

Hi 👋 I’m Loganathan, an Azure Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience turning raw data into reliable, scalable, and business-ready insights.

I thrive at the intersection of data engineering, cloud, and automation — whether it’s:
⚡ Migrating legacy systems to Azure with near-zero downtime
⚡ Designing robust ETL/ELT pipelines that process 1TB+ data daily
⚡ Building logging & monitoring frameworks that save teams hours in debugging
⚡ Or enabling GDPR-compliant solutions trusted by global banks

I’ve had the privilege of working with TD Bank (USA) and ABN AMRO (Netherlands), solving real-world data challenges across finance — from compliance to high-volume analytics. My mission is simple: make data pipelines faster, smarter, and more reliable, so businesses can make decisions with confidence.

When I’m not optimizing pipelines, you’ll find me exploring new tech stacks, mentoring peers, and building reusable frameworks that make engineering teams more efficient.

✨ Let’s connect if you’re working on data migration, governance, or cloud modernization — always excited to share ideas and learn from others in the data community.
